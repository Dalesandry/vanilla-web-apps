# Vanilla Web App Collection
<br />

## Fundamentals Of Web Dev
This repository is a test bed of only using vanilla tools to make websites and web apps. This contains three separate projects that can be expanded on if needed.

### - To-Do Vanilla
- Using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, a simple to-do application that can have items added, marked as completed, and removed.
- To-do items are currently stored in *session storage* for the purpose of this project. When closing the browser tab running this web app, or closing the browser, the session storage will remove itself.
  - By default, I do not want persistent storage for this education project on your computer.
  - If you want to use local storage, replace every instance of `sessionStorage` with `localStorage` in this project's `script.js` file, and the To-Do items will persist even if the tab running this app, or the browser itself, is closed.
<br /><br />

### - Calculator Vanilla
- Using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, a simple calculator that can perform basic math operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
 - All logic is coded by me, to parse a mathematical expression, then solve it using the order of operations, inspired by the functional programming paradigm.
<br /><br />

### - Node.js Routing
- No frameworks, such as express.js, were used. This is used to serve static web pages to the user. Navigation between the calculator and to-do list is possible through these routes.

## Why Make These Tools?
Every single developer is expected to know how to make a to-do list and a calculator. This is my creation of simple web apps that developers are expected to know how to make.
<br /><br />

## Why use Vanilla HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node?
Before allowing myself to use tools that make development easier, such as React, express.js, or any other commonly used Node packages, I would like to make these myself when possible.<br /><br />
The purpose of these applications is to learn why these frameworks exist, and the problems that they solve, by experiencing the common difficulties with using vanilla tools.<br /><br />
The other reason I want to use vanilla tools for this project, is because I think its more fun. While I appreciate other tools being made to make life easier, for me to truly learn and understand something, I have to get my hands dirty and learn how the underlying tools work.
<br /><br />

## This Project is Complete
After finishing the to-do and calculator apps, and getting Node.js to work in serving these static pages, I consider this project finished. Additional apps can be added if desired.
<br /><br />
I have two server files, one being how I managed routes in express.js and as second for plain Node. This was done to see what is abstracted from Node, compared to simpler route handling in express.
